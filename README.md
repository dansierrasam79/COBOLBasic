# COBOLBasic
Just about anyone who sees this repo will wonder whether I've lost my mind. Who would learn COBOL? Noone in today's world. Except IBMers.
Yet the truth be told, I was curious to see how the basics work and which is why I stopped before exploring sequential files
I hope this repo benefits someone
